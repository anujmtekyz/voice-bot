# Testing Architecture for Jira Voice Bot

## Overview

This document outlines the testing architecture implemented for the Jira Voice Bot application, focusing on integration testing with Cypress. The architecture is designed to be resilient to ongoing development and provides good coverage of API endpoints and functional flows.

## Testing Structure

The testing architecture is organized into several layers:

### 1. API Integration Tests

**Purpose**: Verify basic API functionality and infrastructure
**File**: `cypress/e2e/custom-api-integration.cy.ts`
**Coverage**:
- Authentication endpoints
- Error handling
- CORS and security headers
- Mock fixtures for system endpoints

### 2. Working API Tests

**Purpose**: Focus on API endpoints confirmed to be working
**File**: `cypress/e2e/working-api-tests.cy.ts`
**Coverage**:
- Authentication failure handling
- Protected route authorization
- Non-existent endpoint handling
- CORS implementation

### 3. Voice API Tests

**Purpose**: Test the core voice API functionality
**File**: `cypress/e2e/voice-api-test.cy.ts`
**Coverage**:
- Voice command endpoint error handling
- Voice command suggestions endpoint
- Mocked voice command responses

### 4. Voice Integration Tests

**Purpose**: Test the integration between voice API endpoints
**File**: `cypress/e2e/voice-integration-test.cy.ts`
**Coverage**:
- Voice command processing
- Available commands retrieval
- Command history management
- Authentication integration

### 5. Voice Service Integration Tests

**Purpose**: Test the complete voice processing flow
**File**: `cypress/e2e/voice-service-integration.cy.ts`
**Coverage**:
- Audio transcription
- End-to-end command processing
- Voice models and stats

## Testing Approach

### Resilient Testing

Tests are designed to be resilient to ongoing development by:
1. Using `failOnStatusCode: false` to handle 404 errors for not-yet-implemented endpoints
2. Implementing conditional assertions that adapt based on response status
3. Mocking responses for endpoints that might not be fully implemented

### Mock Data Strategy

The testing architecture uses a multi-tiered approach to mock data:
1. **API Interception**: Using `cy.intercept()` to mock API responses
2. **Fixtures**: Using JSON fixtures for consistent test data
3. **Dynamic Mocks**: Generating mock data on the fly for specific test scenarios

### Authentication Handling

Tests handle authentication in several ways:
1. **Unauthenticated Tests**: Testing proper 401 responses
2. **Mock Authentication**: Intercepting auth endpoints to provide mock tokens
3. **localStorage Simulation**: Setting tokens in localStorage to simulate an authenticated state

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using the provided shell script:

```bash
./run-integration-tests.sh
```

The script executes all passing integration tests using Docker and Cypress, providing a summary of results.

## Test Result Reporting

Test results are documented in `test-results.md`, which includes:
1. Summary of test coverage
2. Key findings
3. Implementation status
4. Recommendations

## Extending the Tests

When extending the test suite:

1. **Follow the Pattern**: Use the same resilient testing patterns
2. **Add Appropriate Mocks**: Create relevant mocks for new endpoints
3. **Handle Authentication**: Consider authentication requirements
4. **Update Documentation**: Update the result summary after running new tests

## Known Limitations

1. UI tests are not yet implemented as the frontend is under development
2. Some API endpoints return 404 and are tested with mocks
3. The login functionality has an issue with refresh token generation

## Future Improvements

1. Add UI component tests once the frontend is implemented
2. Replace mocks with real API calls as endpoints are completed
3. Add performance and load testing for critical endpoints
4. Implement end-to-end tests that cover complete user journeys
