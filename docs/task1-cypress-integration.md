# Task 1: Cypress Integration Testing Implementation

## What We've Built

We've implemented a comprehensive Cypress testing suite to verify the successful integration of the System Status component with the backend API. This ensures that the frontend and backend components work together seamlessly.

### 1. Component Preparation

- **Data Attributes**: Added `data-cy` attributes throughout the `SystemStatus` component for stable test selectors
- **State Handling**: Ensured component properly handles loading, success, and error states
- **Accessibility**: Made component accessible for keyboard navigation testing

### 2. Cypress Configuration

- **Configuration File**: Created `cypress.config.ts` with appropriate settings
- **Support Files**: Set up `e2e.ts` and `commands.ts` with custom commands
- **Fixtures**: Added test fixtures for mocking API responses
- **Package Scripts**: Added scripts to package.json for running tests

### 3. Custom Commands

- **checkSystemStatusComponent**: Verifies all sections of the component are present
- **tab**: For keyboard navigation testing
- **until**: For complex conditional tab navigation

### 4. Test Suites

- **Component Tests** (`system-status.cy.ts`): Tests the component in isolation
- **Integration Tests** (`system-integration.cy.ts`): Tests the full API integration
- **Fixture Tests** (`system-fixture-test.cy.ts`): Tests with fixture-based mocking

### 5. Test Cases Implemented

- Verifying component renders correctly
- Checking data from API is displayed properly
- Testing error handling
- Verifying UI updates on data refresh
- Testing API intercepts and mocking
- Accessibility testing via keyboard navigation

## Running the Tests

1. **Start Both Servers**:
```bash
pnpm run start:servers
```

2. **Run Cypress Tests Headlessly**:
```bash
pnpm run cypress:run
```

3. **Open Cypress UI**:
```bash
pnpm run cypress:open
```

## Test Automation

All tests can be run automatically via:
```bash
pnpm run cypress:e2e
```

This command:
1. Starts the frontend and backend servers
2. Runs all Cypress tests
3. Shuts down all servers

## Mock Testing vs. Real API Testing

Our testing strategy includes both:

1. **Real API Testing**: Tests against the actual backend API
2. **Mock API Testing**: Uses fixtures and intercepts to test edge cases

## Benefits of the Implementation

- **Confidence in Integration**: Verifies the frontend and backend work together
- **Regression Protection**: Catches issues if either component changes
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Tests error states and recovery paths
- **Full End-to-End Verification**: Tests the entire flow from UI to API and back

## Future Enhancements

- Add visual regression testing
- Expand tests to cover more complex interactions
- Add performance testing for API response times
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

By implementing these Cypress tests, we've ensured that the integration between the frontend SystemStatus component and the backend API is robust, reliable, and correctly handles all states.
