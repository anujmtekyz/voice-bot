## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

1. **Implement Redis Status Check**
   - Replace the placeholder Redis status check with real Redis connection verification

2. **Add Admin Dashboard Section**
   - Create a dedicated admin view with more detailed system information
   - Include system logs and error monitoring

3. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Add more comprehensive test cases for edge conditions
   - Add visual regression tests for UI components

4. **Setup CI Pipeline**
   - Configure GitHub Actions to run tests automatically
   - Add deployment workflow

5. **Enhance System Monitoring**

## ðŸ§ª How to Test

### Jest and API Tests

Run the following command to test the entire integration:

```bash
./test-e2e.sh
```

For testing just the system status component:

```bash
pnpm test:system-status
```

### Cypress E2E Tests

For running Cypress UI tests:

```bash
# Open Cypress UI with all servers running
pnpm run cypress:open

# Run all Cypress tests headlessly
pnpm run cypress:e2e
```
