# Frontend Authentication Integration

## Overview

We've successfully integrated the backend authentication API with the frontend components. The frontend now properly communicates with the backend for all authentication operations including login, logout, password management, and user profile updates.

## Components Updated

1. **Login Form** 
   - Now uses the auth context to handle login requests
   - Properly handles errors and loading states
   - Integrates with the backend login API

2. **Forgot Password & Reset Password Forms**
   - Connected to the respective backend APIs
   - Improved error handling and user feedback

3. **User Header Menu**
   - Shows authenticated user information with avatar
   - Uses the proper logout API endpoint
   - Displays user initials or fallback icon

4. **User Profile Page**
   - Fetches and displays real user data
   - Implements profile editing capability
   - Saves changes through API

5. **Application Layout**
   - Added AuthProvider context to make auth state available throughout the app

## Authentication Flow

1. User enters credentials in login form
2. Frontend sends credentials to `/api/auth/login` endpoint
3. On success, JWT tokens are stored in cookies
4. User profile is fetched from `/api/auth/me`
5. Protected routes check for valid tokens via middleware
6. Token refresh happens automatically via axios interceptors

## Next Steps

1. **Voice API Integration**
   - Connect voice command components to backend APIs
   - Implement real-time voice processing

2. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Connect dashboard components to backend data sources

3. **JIRA Integration**
   - Implement the connection between user JIRA settings and API

4. **Fix Known Issues**
   - Address the user_id null bug in refresh token generation
   - Implement proper error handling for API failures
