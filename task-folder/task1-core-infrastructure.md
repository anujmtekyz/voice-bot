# Task 1: Core Infrastructure Setup

This task focuses on setting up the core infrastructure for the JIRA Voice Bot application, establishing the foundation for all subsequent development.

## Objectives
- Set up NestJS project with TypeScript configuration
- Configure database connections and ORM
- Implement logging, error handling, and common utilities
- Set up Docker development environment

## Subtasks

### 1.1 Project Boilerplate and Configuration
- [x] Create NestJS project structure with proper modules organization
- [x] Configure TypeScript with strict rules for code quality
- [x] Set up environment variables and configuration management
- [ ] Configure CORS for frontend integration
- [ ] Create Docker Compose for local development
  - [ ] PostgreSQL service
  - [ ] Redis service for caching
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints (`GET /api/system/status` and `GET /api/system/version`)

### 1.2 Swagger API Documentation
- [ ] Install and configure Swagger for API documentation
- [ ] Set up base Swagger configuration with authentication
- [ ] Create API description and tags matching API requirements
- [ ] Configure example request/response models

### 1.3 Database Setup
- [ ] Implement TypeORM configuration for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Set up database migration system
- [ ] Create base entity classes with common fields
- [ ] Configure repository pattern for data access
- [ ] Implement database seeding for development environment
- [ ] Set up transaction management

### 1.4 Error Handling
- [ ] Create global exception filter
- [ ] Implement custom exception classes
  - [ ] Application exception base class
  - [ ] Entity not found exception
  - [ ] Validation exception
  - [ ] Authentication exceptions
  - [ ] Authorization exceptions
- [ ] Configure request validation using class-validator
- [ ] Implement error logging middleware

### 1.5 Response Formatting
- [ ] Create standard response format interceptor
- [ ] Implement pagination helper for list endpoints
- [ ] Set up response serialization with class-transformer
- [ ] Create helper functions for success/error responses

### 1.6 Logging Service
- [ ] Set up Winston logger integration
- [ ] Configure different log levels based on environment
- [ ] Implement request logging middleware
- [ ] Create context-based logging utility
- [ ] Set up log rotation for production

### 1.7 Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Configure Jest for unit testing
- [ ] Set up test database for integration tests
- [ ] Create test utilities and mocks
- [ ] Implement sample unit and integration tests
- [ ] Configure CI pipeline for automated testing

## API Endpoints To Be Implemented:

```
GET /api/system/status - Get system status
GET /api/system/version - Get application version
```

## Verification Criteria
- Docker containers run successfully
- Database connection is established and migrations work
- Logging is properly configured with different levels
- Error handling returns consistent response format
- Global exception filter catches and formats all errors
- API endpoints are properly documented in Swagger
- Health check endpoints return proper system status

## Dependencies
- NestJS framework knowledge
- TypeORM experience
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 
- Redis
- Understanding of API requirements document

## Estimated Time
- 2-3 days
