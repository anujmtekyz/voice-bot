## Implementation Details

1. **Core Infrastructure**:
   - Implemented NestJS project structure with dedicated modules for auth, users, system, etc.
   - Set up TypeORM configuration with PostgreSQL integration
   - Created Docker Compose file for PostgreSQL and Redis services

2. **API Documentation**:
   - Configured Swagger with proper authentication setup
   - Added API tags and descriptions for different modules
   - Implemented proper API response models and documentation

3. **Error Handling and Response Standardization**:
   - Created a global HTTP exception filter that formats all errors consistently
   - Implemented a transform interceptor for standardizing successful responses
   - Set up request validation with class-validator

4. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Integrated Winston logger with different transports based on environment
   - Set up log rotation for production
   - Implemented request logging middleware to track all HTTP requests

5. **Health Checks**:
   - Created system health endpoint that checks database and service connectivity
   - Implemented version endpoint to expose application version information

## Running Instructions

1. Start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run start:dev
   ```

4. Access the Swagger documentation:
   http://localhost:3001/api/docs

5. Check the health endpoints:
   - http://localhost:3001/api/system/status
   - http://localhost:3001/api/system/version
