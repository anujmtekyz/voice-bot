## API Endpoints To Be Implemented:

```
# Authentication APIs
POST /api/auth/login - User login with email/password
POST /api/auth/logout - User logout
POST /api/auth/refresh-token - Refresh authentication token
POST /api/auth/forgot-password - Initiate password reset
POST /api/auth/reset-password - Complete password reset with token
GET /api/auth/me - Get current user information

# User Management APIs
GET /api/users/profile - Get user profile information
PUT /api/users/profile - Update user profile information
PUT /api/users/password - Change user password
GET /api/users/preferences - Get user preferences
PUT /api/users/preferences - Update user preferences
